## Build MD/JS for this computer and run it in Hatari with EmuMD (see
## README.md). TOS= a TOS image (default: EmuMD's EmuTOS); RECORD=FILE.avi
## records picture and sound until you quit; EMUMD= another EmuMD checkout.

	$(EMUMD)/tools/mdfw run $(if $(TOS),--tos "$(TOS)") $(if $(RECORD),--record "$(RECORD)")

## Test it there, headless: JavaScript's fetch() from an ST program, and a
## boot with WiFi slow to connect (emu/test.sh).
